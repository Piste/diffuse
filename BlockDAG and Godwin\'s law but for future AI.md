My first a-ha moment with Bitcoin was when I understood that nodes used a bittorrent-like peer-to-peer communication method. My thought, soon afterward was “if this blockchain thing I don’t understand has any merit, bitcoin will be impossible to kill. There was then a lot of money being thrown by record and movie industry associations in the fight to scare pirates. But bittorrent never went away. The music industry changed forever. I wondered what a means of transaction you could not stop would do to banks, governments and federal/central authorities of money printing.

When I understood that Ethereum could be the host onto which a new form of governance could run, through smart contracts that evolve like updated versions of code, I had a second epiphany.

Today it is for IOTA that my mind finally clicked. I am yet to read the whitepaper but from what I understood listening to David Sønstebø on [The Ether Review](https://etherreview.info/ether-review-69-iota-the-post-blockchain-era-591f00e2ea5d) then we’re dealing with some alternate form of chain, more like a block-tree than a block-chain - technically it’s a [DAG](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2283757/can-someone-explain-in-simple-terms-to-me-what-a-directed-acyclic-graph-is) - and nodes don’t need to have a the whole chain (contrarily to bitcoin or ethereum) in order to communicate and validate that a transaction or work has happened.  There are also no fees on transaction and a bunch of other mind blowing statements I am yet to read about. Like, for example the fact that Serguei Popov, one of the six members of the foundation helped create proof-of-stake (?! citation needed).

So far, this new technology seems like what IoT needs, indeed: a means of transacting that is lightweight, transient, with low cost and indestructible. That indestructibility made me think of the Terminator movie series. “Machines” *are* getting smarter. It seems like AI and ML are what makes the headlines, nowadays. Almost literally.

When machines start transacting and optimizing themselves or each other, how will we keep a finger on the switch? Where is the IOTA switch? Are we building the most important base layer that General AI needs to guarantee its survival?

That last apocalyptic part sounds trite. Just like Godwin's law for any argument that ends up invoking Hitler, there should be a rule about any new technology text mentioning the end of mankind as a result of its use.
