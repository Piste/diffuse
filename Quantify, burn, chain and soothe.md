It took me years but I eventually realized that chasing real-time updates and most recent posts was leaving me frustrated and overly impacted by superficial information. In reaction, I have started making a conscious effort to reduce my intake of short-term event-based data and increase the time I spend consuming long-form articles and books. This means pruning the list of people I follow on Twitter, unsubscribing from lower value RSS feeds and laying off Reddit a little. In theory this should allow me more time to dig through the pile of unread Instapaper articles I have amassed. Maybe one day I'll be able to read a majority of the books I have in my Goodreads wishlist.

Speaking of Instapaper, my queue depth standing in the lower three digits, I resorted to an old management adage: If you can't measure it, you can't manage it. I wanted to chart my progress. As I consume and plan to read articles regularly, I needed to see whether the trend was pointing towards an empty queue or an ever-growing list of articles I would never get to. So I put together a few apps to allow me to send these stats to a spreadsheet. It starts with a Workflow that asks me for a number. I trigger this Workflow by tapping its icon on my iOS Notification Center. The measurement is then sent with today's time and date to an ifttt action that will add this record to a simple Google Docs spreadsheet. I can then draw bars, lines, and curves based on hard numerical facts.

So far, the trend is flat. Let me know if you want me to share the above pieces.

I got a [burner](https://burnerapp.com). JOKE ABOUT THE TV SHOW THE WIRE. This is a disposable phone number that I can give willingly to anyone. At the first notice of incoming abuse or annoyance through this number, I request a new number and discard the old one. I can give this number to car salesmen, to people on Craigslist, to online companies I have tentative trust in, etc. People in a different sentimental situation than mine would be well-advised to also use a burner for dating. This is not a free service but the convenience and safety is well worth it.

It has been awkward for me to simultaneously love Bitcoin and be unable to effortlessly explain its principles to neophytes who desire to know more. Twitter brought me this magnificent video over the weekend: [Blockchain 101 - A Visual Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8&feature=youtu.be) by Anders Brownworth. It lasts less than 18 minutes and it will easily clarify 6 of the most important tenets of Bitcoin. I would recommend you go watch it now.

And finally a bit of polling. When you go see your favorite general practicioner, do you ask your her/him to explain what your ailment is? Do you enquire as to what each drugâ€™s effect will be? Which drugs in the prescription help reduce the symptoms, which ones address the root cause?
