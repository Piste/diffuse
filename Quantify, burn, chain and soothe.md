It took me years but I eventually realized that chasing real-time updates and most recent posts left me frustrated and overly impacted by superficial information. In reaction, I have started making a conscious effort to reduce my intake of short-term event-based data and increase the time I spend consuming long-form articles and books. This means pruning the list of people I follow on Twitter, unsubscribing from lower value RSS feeds and laying off Reddit a little. In theory, this should allow me more time to dig through the pile of unread Instapaper articles I have amassed. Maybe one day I'll be able to read a majority of the books in my Goodreads wishlist.

Speaking of Instapaper, with a queue depth stacking at lower three digits, I resorted to an old management adage: If you can't measure it, you can't manage it. I wanted to chart my progress. As I consume (out) and plan to read articles (in) regularly, I needed to see whether the trend was pointing towards an empty queue or an ever-growing list of articles I would never get to. So I put together a few apps to allow me to send these stats to a spreadsheet. It starts with a [Workflow](https://my.workflow.is/) that asks me for a number. I trigger this Workflow by tapping its icon in the iOS Notification Center and I enter the latest unread count - visible as a badge on the Instapaper icon. The measurement is then sent with today's time and date to an [ifttt](https://ifttt.com/) action that will append this record to a simple Google Docs spreadsheet. I can then draw bars, lines, and curves based on hard numerical facts.

So far, the trend is flat. Let me know if you want me to share the above pieces.

I got a [burner](https://burnerapp.com). JOKE ABOUT THE TV SHOW THE WIRE. This is a disposable phone number that I can give willy-nilly to anyone. At the first notice of incoming abuse or annoyance, I will request a new number and discard the previous one. I can give this number to car salesmen, to people on Craigslist, to online companies I have tentative trust in, etc. People in a different sentimental situation than mine would be well-advised to also use a burner for dating. This is not a free service but the convenience and safety is well worth it.

The initial impulse for obtaining this number stems from reading a "43 productivity tips for busy people" type of article. This one resonated with me: specify the medium you would like people to use to contact you. Not yet sure what mine is but txt is a good start. There is a phone number in my .sig now.

It has been awkward for me to simultaneously love Bitcoin and be unable to effortlessly explain its principles to eager neophytes. Twitter brought me this magnificent video over the weekend: [Blockchain 101 - A Visual Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8&feature=youtu.be) by Anders Brownworth. It lasts less than 18 minutes and it will easily clarify 6 of the most important tenets of Bitcoin. I would recommend you go watch it now. Or send it to your Watch Later queue...

And finally a bit of polling. When you go see your favorite general practitioner, do you ask her/him to explain what your ailment is? Do you enquire as to what each drugâ€™s effect will be? Which drugs in the prescription help reduce the symptoms, which ones address the root cause?
