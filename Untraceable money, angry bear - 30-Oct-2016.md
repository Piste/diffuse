This is the first opus of what I plan to make a regular posting activity. It'll all depend on how long it takes me and how long I want to put into it. But I have always wanted to share the things which - I believe - will impact the world, or impact my daily life.
Here we go. All feedback welcome.

## Major shifts
### [Zcash](https://z.cash/) went live
If you have any faith in Bitcoin, you will probably be interested in Zcash. It is a crypto-currency that relies on zero-knowledge proof. I won't pretend to understand the underpinnings (I am still non-actively reading [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Unlocking-Digital-Cryptocurrencies/dp/1449374042/) by [Andreas Antonopoulos](https://twitter.com/aantonop)) but I can sense the potential. Bitcoin has debatable fungibility because all transactions and wallets are in the open. Blockchain analysis allows researchers to tie transactions to specific marketplaces like the late Silk Road. How long until law enforcement and governments decide that money spent on illegal activities is not to be spent again? This is the paranoid view. There are [other arguments](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-fungibility-essential/) as to why Bitcoin fungibility matters i.e all coins have the same value.

Zcash offers a set of algorithms that allow transcations to be validated and confirmed by the network of miners without the need for sender or recipient identity/address to be known. It also obsucates the amount sent. All of this is optional, you can still make it all transparent if you so desire. Here is an easy [infographic to grasp this](https://blockchainhub.net/blog/infographics/zcash-explained/).

This is also a currency that has received intense [security scrutiny](https://z.cash/blog/audit-results.html).

#### Why is this important?
Because Bitcoin's traceability might be a chink in its armor. It might harm its adoption in the long-run. Zcash attempts to be the internet equivalent of cash you have in your pocket or wallet. You do not know the history of the bills you own. You don't need to and shouldn't care about it.

### Russia is showing its teeth
- [Norway welcomes US Marines amid Russian tensions](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/18/politics/marines-norway-russia/index.html)
- [Russia unveils 'Satan 2' missile powerful enough to 'wipe out UK, France or Texas'](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/25/russia-unveils-satan-2-missile-powerful-enough-to-wipe-out-uk-fr/)
- [NATO Calls for More Troops for Largest Military Build-up on Russia's Borders Since Cold War](http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/1.749274)

Dan Carlin, in his Common Sense podcast, made it clear that [poking the bear](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/common-sense-270-poking-the-bear/) was not a great idea. NATO did not abide by an early advice to not exploit the temporary weakness of Russia, after the wall fell. More and more ex-USSR countries were seduced into joining the pact of non-aggression. Now, who is going to defend Lithuania, for example, if it was to see Russian tanks at its border?

Dan's concern about the US leadership and its lack of incentives to de-escalate resonates with me. Did we really need a Cold War II?


## Tools and toys
### My Apple Watch disappeared
A guest at home realized he still had it on his wrist ("trying it on") when traveling away from my home. I do not miss it. This in itself is a testament to how little I need the device. If he had gone with my phone I'd probably be freaking out. Or testing resiliency skills by awakening the Android phone I used this summer when abroad.

### Speaking of being abroad
I have switched to T-Mobile. I have enjoyed using internet-based resources while not in my country of residence. It was glorious and it felt like the future. I had been using a portable wifi access point (AKA mobile hotspot) before, due to AT&T's prohibitive international rates. I have also experienced the lesser coverage that T-Mo offers. As of now I can deal with the trade-off.

### Tracking spend

I will use [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) more. I want to know how I spend this universal and undervalued resource: Time. Tim Urban, author of the waitbutwhy.com website touches upon my this very clearly in [a recent post](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html). (If you don't know waitbutwhy.com, go ahead and read his series on Musk. It is as fun to read as it is educative.)

### Bone conduction
I have returned the [bone conduction headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018XNGQOE/) I had purchased as a trial. They are quite magical, especially in a silent environment and while plugging your ear holes. Love saying "ear holes". I tried them in the street and it was a deal-breaker right away. Couldn't hear anything but the outside world. Great tech, needs more time. Or needs earplugs - which it comes with, very smart - but then the safety-reinforcing aspect goes out the window. You're supposed to be able to enjoy your music/spoken audio while safely paying attention to traffic around you.

### Apple has released a new MacBook Pro
And it has a touch screen instead of a bar of function keys. It looks amazing. Like a stringy iPhone screen that can display the options you need contextually. It is also an interesting choice. Every time my eyes leave the screen to look at the keyboard I feel a bit of failure inside.

### Media and Entertainment
- I litterally cried in laughter a few times thanks to [/r/BetterEveryLoop/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterEveryLoop/)
- I am very excited by the return of [Black Mirror](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/episodes?season=3&ref_=tt_eps_sn_3). Black Mirror is a tv show that offers quality scifi, mostly looking at the social impact of quasi-hard science developments 5-15 years in the future. The season 2 Christmas special with Jon Hamm was quite a treat. When you're done watching it, make sure to enjoy Future Thinkers' podcast episode  [with Robin Hanson about The Age of Em](http://futurethinkers.org/robin-hanson-age-of-em/).
- Finished listening to [Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens). Impressive book<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. I particularly enjoyed the part about myths that structure our social lives, the shitty life that our animal source of food always had, even pre-industrial agriculture, and the birth of money. The latter reminded me of Nick Szabo's extensive essay on the topic: [Artifacts of wealth: patterns in the evolution of collectibles and money](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2016/07/artifacts-of-wealth-patterns-in_15.html)

Thanks for reading thus far. This took me too long this time and probably took you too long to read too. I'll try a smaller bite size next time.
