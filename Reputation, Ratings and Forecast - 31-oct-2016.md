### Reclaiming time
Over the summer, my wife and I sold our television. We had made a joke about it in the past. It was not a difficult decision but we had become pretty used to watching shows every night almost. I was feeling a pang of guilt about how much time it took our couple. Our consumption was mainly of tv shows. I cannot say I am a chord-cutter as I never really had cable. For most of my teenage years as well as my twenties, I didn't have a tv at all.

We sold it on Craigslist and haven't missed it.

I've been a gamer since I was a child. I never tried to tally up how much time I spent playing but I would average it at above 5 hours per week. About three weeks ago, I decided that I needed to free up some time in my life. I had no other goal than to **create vacuum** again and find out how it got filled. So I decided that I would stop playing video games. I have gotten a lot of pleasure and joy from playing games since I was a kid. I went cold turkey. Still not missing it.

What can one do with all this time on their hands?

### Flat key holder thingie
I had been passively searching for a good, space-saving, non-thigh-poking, lean way to hold my keys. I recently acquired a [KeySmart](https://getkeysmart.com/products/keysmart) and it does the job. Happy.

## Media & Entertainment
### Rating agency
The [first episode of Black Mirror, Season 3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5497778) is a reflection on a social network reputation society. It is frightening in its accuracy and foresight - as are most Black Mirror episodes. Each encounter is an opportunity to give and receive ratings. One could easily make the case that we are just one aggregating web service away from this reality taking shape. Uber drivers [rate their passengers](http://www.popsugar.com/tech/How-See-Your-Uber-Passenger-Rating-36846438), Airbnb hosts review their guests and eBay is just a massive review fest. What would it take? A few agreements, some API calls and linking the various user identities. A lot of people simply use the same username on different websites but in a worst effort scenario, linking identities to each other in order to merge them and attach them to a single individual is probably a challenge that Ad Tech firms are in the midst of solving. [Peeple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peeple/id1008896593) tried to build this from scratch. If the app store reviews are any indication, this has not caught on yet. Facebook does not seem to desire becoming a player in this arena - despite an ideal situation. China, on the other hand, is creating a [Social Credit System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System).

The above reputation shouldn't be confused with REP, the currency that will power [Augur](https://www.augur.net/). It is a prediction market based on Ethereum<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> which makes it the first betting place in history that will suffer neither from corruption nor censorship. In a first future shock stage, it could simply predict the future, by offering the probability of an event based on the wisdom of the ~crowd<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup>, assuming crowds are better at divining the future than a subset of experts. In a second stage, Augur could become the place where people decide on what the future should be, by voting (or betting) on a specific outcome, thereby incentivizing the advent further.

(The other side of the Augur coin is that a "bad actor" would stand to make a lot of money by betting on the upset of a massive and overwhelmingly supported bet, and creating enough disruption to bring odds in his favor. Destroying is easier than creating.)

### Messed up
[Cyriak](https://twitter.com/cyriakharris) has started streaming some of his vices (After Effects, Doom, [FL Studio](http://www.image-line.com/flstudio/)) on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cyriak_h). I love his [disturbing music videos](http://cyriak.co.uk/animation/).

<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) being a blockchain-based platform for running smart contracts.

<a name="myfootnote2">2</a>: The term "crowd" here might unfortunately carry a lot less diversity than assumed. At first it will probably constitute of highly educated white nerds.
