## Less is more, more is less
Trees shed their leaves before the winter, only to regrow them in the spring and become bigger. There is a mesmerizing scene in the [Jungle episode](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0905877/?ref_=ttep_ep8) of Planet Earth, showing a dramatically accelerated vision of vegetable life. In a time-lapse, ferns unroll like party blowers, a budding vine tries its best and manages to hang on to a neighboring branch, and moss expands, shrinks, further expands like the lateral cut of a breathing lung. Vegetable and animal become one, when observed in the proper time scale.

Growing and shrinking, or expanding and shedding apply at the human scale. This is how I perceive my social subscriptions. I adventurously subscribe to new RSS feeds and happily follow new accounts on Twitter. But this is only sustainable if I can show the same eagerness in doing the opposite. When I realized that Twitter had become a source of negativity in my life, I aggressively started cutting 'dead branches' and removing noxious sources. No hard feelings. This isn't Facebook after all.

I also do this with subreddits. And I look forward to do this on [yours.network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MUt6n7cXc) (4 min. video pitch) as soon as it's out.

## Tools and toys
### Atom takes the cake
Mastery puts us in awe. I have been amazed by coworkers or fellow students who were able to manipulate lines of code through - what I could once only assume were - keyboard-based runic incantations. If you have witnessed a vi or emacs power user in action, you know what I mean. If you don't, picture a movie that depicts a hacker: lots of typing, many things moving on the hacker's screen and this particular feeling that you don't fully grasp what is going on. This, but in real life and with tangible results.

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) was the first editor which inspired enough desire in me - through visual appeal - to make me want to use it seriously. I never did. Despite the cool "launcher", officially named the Command Palette (⌘⇧P) which allows you to trigger any action you can type.

Then came [Atom](https://atom.io/). GitHub-created. Obviously inspired by the above, yet so much more self-explanatory, intuitive and non-condescending. Anyone can pick it up and start using it instead of Notepad or Notes. Yet, [with a little bit of curiosity](https://www.sitepoint.com/10-essential-atom-add-ons/), you will quickly find yourself propelled into a world of efficiency. It even has low profile and remarkably useful tips when you stare a blank window, reminiscent of a video game that would give you hints during loading screens. Simply brilliant.

What I'm trying to say is **you** can be this hacker in a shitty tech-wannabe movie.
